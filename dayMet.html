                    Obviously we remember the day we met. Well, I at least hope you do. You did think we started dating in 2023
                    so maybe you dont remember some things. First, I am going to tell you about the man that I was before you. 
                    You can see the picture of me there. Girls bid day, August 20th, 2022. I was wandering around, aimlessly, just
                    hoping to make a friend and get out of my apartment. It was a lonely summer for me in Lindale. My parents were gone,
                    friends were at work, no internet at home. All I had was work and the gym. I moved in to The Cardinal on August 5th, 2023.
                    None of my roommates moved in until the 14th, so I was lonely. Bid day was the first day that I was able to go out and try 
                    to make new friends and hang out with people. Little did I know what I had in store for me that night. I was hanging out at
                    the Zeta bid day because of Lillian and was just standing there awkwardly because I had no one to talk to. I stood there for hours 
                    because I hadn't talked to anyone in person all summer and I was nervous. After a failed attempt to make some friends and meet new people,
                    I went home and just sat in my room. After a few hours, I get a text saying that Snu was throwing and that I should come. 
                    Being fresh out of pledgeship, I jumped to the idea of a party at the house. I was so excited to see everybody again and 
                    be in a place where I was wanted. After I got dressed, I made sure to go to 508 to see if the other girls were going. Eventually
                    we all left for Snu. After being there for an hour or two, not many people had come to talk to me and I was extrememly sad.
                    Eventually, I found Lillian and went to Andrew's room with her and a few friends. I sat up there and talked to everyone and had my feet
                    out the window listening to music and just wishing that I had someone to talk to. After a while of sitting there. We were going to 
                    make an attempt to go home. I was outside of Andrew's room when I see Sydney walk in with the most beautiful girl I had ever seen.
                    I genienly think that my jaw dropped a little. I rememebr thinking in my head that I had you on BeReal and reacted to a few of your BeReals
                    and liked your stories on Instagram hoping you'd notice me. According to you, you had noticed me all along and went the Snu to meet me.
                    Is this the truth? I guess we will never know until I put you on a lie detector. I remember you walked in and seriously my heart was
                    pounding. I didn't know what to say or do, but words just started coming out and I kept following you around. We talked for a while
                    and I eventually told you about my stinky apartment and you said that you would give me a candle for my apartnemnt. After talking for a long
                    time, we all walked home together and went to Sydney's apartment. There, getting to know you better, I knew that I wanted you. We talked in that room
                    for so long, Sydney was falling asleep on the couch while we just talked and talked and you said that the villian from Kung Fu panda was a hot cartoon 
                    character. We eventually left, and on the way out, I popped the question and asked for your snap/number. You gave them to me and we ended up texting right after That
                    I remember just standing in the shower staring at my phone smiling ear to ear while I was talking to me. I kept thinking of how badly I wanted to see you again
                    I was seriously obsessed from the start and I still am to this day.
