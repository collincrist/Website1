                    Make sure to start the song!!! I don't know why I wanted to make this, but here we are lol.
                    This was one of the hardest things that I have done in a long time and I really wish you could understand how long this actaully took.
                    Obviously, I am willing to put in the time for you, but damn was this time consuming lol.
                    I really hope you enjoy this "small" little project that I came up with. I put 
                    small in quotes because this was not a small feat at all. You'll see on the videos I assume. I would start out 
                    in the "How I Made This" tab. That's where I'll be explaining how I made this website.
                    This was grueling hard work, but will be so worth it if I get a nice reaction and a smile out of you.
