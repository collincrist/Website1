                    Make sure to start the song!!! I don't know why I wanted to make this, but here we are lol.
                    This was one of the hardest things that I have done in a long time and I really wish you could understand how long this actaully took.
                    Obviously, I am willing to put in the time for you, but damn was this time consuming lol.
                    I really hope you enjoy this "small" little project that I came up with. I put 
                    small in quotes because this was not a small feat at all. You'll see on the videos I assume. I would start out 
                    in the "How I Made This" tab. That's where I'll be explaining how I made this website.
                    This was grueling hard work, but will be so worth it if I get a nice reaction and a smile out of you. You are, of course my best friend! 
                    I really need to go to the gym lol, but I have just been so busy doing this! Looking at this, I am proud of it,
                    but it is very underwhelming lol. But! I know you will enjoy it just because I put my time into it. I love you so much
                    and I can't wait to see you in a few days. Let me know if I should put more on this eventually! This is a live website that you
                    can visit at any time!
